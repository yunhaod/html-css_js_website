                <p> I really want a shiba (maybe more than 1) in the future. It has inspired me to make 
                    my own pet-feeding device that I can control from afar. In this project, the heart of 
                    long distance control is WebSockets, an IoT protocol that supports bidirectional, real-time, and long term connections 
                    between clients and servers. Here, an iOS app and the physical device are connected for communication and command execution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app contains features for feeding food and refilling water. More technical details about the project can be found in this <a href="" target="_blank"> GitHub Repository </a>

                    The WebSocket server was initially hosted locally, which transitioned into usage of 
                    AWS Elastic Compute Cloud for improvements in security and reliability for application.

            <p> The iOS app has 2 views, which has a page for connection as well as the other page for the majority of functionalities.
                When the app receives a warning for low water content in the bowl, the warning disappears
                after water is refilled.

                    An ESP32 was used for WiFi connectivity to connect to the WebSocket server.

                    The physical device consists of servo motors for replenishing food and a peristaltic liquid pump for water refill. The servo motor would flip open the 
                    cap (as shown in the gif) for food to fall out, and close the cap after a time interval.

        <div class="takeaway_content">
                <p> This project was really fun to build. It exposed me to a different IoT protocols as well as 
                    other aspects of embedded software. It was exciting when the WebSocket server echoed messages correctly 
                    and integrating it into Swift for app design.
