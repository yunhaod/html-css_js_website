        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project consists of hardware and software components, where the Arduino is responsible for reading sensor data 
            and transmitting the data over Bluetooth. The python script attempts to scan for the Arduino and obtain the sensor readings,
            logging it into a CSV file periodically. The data in the CSV file can be analyzed by plotting the changes over time.
            The scripts can be found in the following <a href = "https://github.com/yunhaod/DataPulse" target="_blank" >GitHub Repository</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The CAD model features a battery, microcontroller, and sensor for detecting data around the environment.
            The system is all contained in a case for wireless communication.

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Across multiple systems of the project, whether its software or hardware, 
            each system succeeds in completing its tasks of the project, ensuring reliability 
            for any users who might find this project useful.</p>

                <h2>Prototype</h2>
                <p> In my project, my Arduino offers sensor service with the characteristics of humidity and temperature. </p>
                <p>The python script is able to detect nearby Bluetooth modules and filter by the name of the devices it discovers. 
                    Upon encountering an Arduino, it will connect and attempt to read for specific characteristics 
                    (in this case, humidity & temperature). 
                </p>
                <p> The data is periodically logged into a CSV file, which can then be analyzed with Matplotlibs for changes over time
                    using the data analysis file.

                <p>From this project, I was able to learn more and interface with Bluetooth features.
                    It allowed me to fully explore what its like to be working on an embedded project,
                    along with some additional software additions to enhance the capabilities.</p>

                <p> The project was also made to be customizable for anyone who might find this application helpful, whether its 
                    adding addtional services to the microcontroller, or more characteristics to each service.
